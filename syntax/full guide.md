# R
## Syntax
### variable
`variable` must be an `identifier`.

An `identifier` in R must satisfy these requirements. Like that in other programming language.

+ It only consists of one or many uppercase letter (i.e. `A` to `Z`), lowercase letter (i.e. `a` to `z`), digit (i.e. `0` to `9`), and underscore (i.e. `_`).
+ The first character must be an uppercase letter or lowercase letter.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `identifier` in R is case-sensitive.

#### Definition of variable 
It is first defined if and only if it is assigned at first time.

| symbol | is forbidden? | recommended |
